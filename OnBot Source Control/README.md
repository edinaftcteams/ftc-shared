# OnBot Source Control
OnBot is a great way to get code running quickly, especially if your team is short on Android Studio resources (people or computers.) The problem has been how to protect your code using GitHub or your favorite source control tool. There are solutions!

The information included here came from other FTC teams that solved the problem and shared the solutions on the forums. There are probably other solutions out there and more to come, so don't hesitate to share anything that looks useful.

There are a couple of ways to get your OnBot code off the phone and stored somewhere else.
- Copy and Paste the code from the OnBot browser window to your laptop.
- Right click on the OnBot file and a download button will appear. Download to your laptop.
- Use the utility from here [TheLostLanbda](https://github.com/TheLostLambda/ftc_http/releases) to copy files both ways.
- Read this link [OnBot Source Control](https://ftcforum.usfirst.org/forum/ftc-technology/65266-onbot-java-and-source-control) to use OnBot and Android Studio together. This provides a way to change and debug code without plugging the phone into your laptop!
Once you have the files on your laptop, they can be added to your local GitHub repository and pushed to GitHub just like using Android Studio or GitHub Desktop.
