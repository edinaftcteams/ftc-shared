# ftc-shared

## Shared Information

This repository contains code and other technical information to share
with all FTC teams. It is intended to be a place to store and share
code, classes, modules, and documentation. Most of the code here is in Java but there is lots of information that is applicable to whatever  programming environment your team may be using.

This repository is **not** an Android FTC app project os it cannot be directly compiled into usable op modes.

The [TeamCodeSamples](TeamCodeSamples) folder contains classes and op
modes that illustrate strategies and designs from past and current
seasons.

The [Wiki](../../wiki) contains articles and documentation explaining
various topics and concepts that may be helpful to your team.

Read the code and any instructions before you cut and paste it into your
project. Most of the items included here are meant to help speed up your
development by minimizing the "re-invent the wheel" syndrome and at the
same time help you understand various aspects of software
development.

> **Note:** The classes under the [TeamCodeSamples](TeamCodeSamples)
> folder are op modes and supporting classes which may have dependencies
> on either the FTC software development kit or other external
> libraries. Be aware that you may need to install some of these if they
> are not already in your project.

## Using the Code

1. Read the code and any documentation.
2. Decide if it might be useful in your project.
3. Copy it to your project. Copy and paste **only** if you understand
   the code.
4. Make any changes required to incorporate it into your code.
5. Create some test code to verify it does what you expect.

## Updates
