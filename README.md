# ftc-shared

## Shared Information

This repository contains code and other technical information to share with all FTC teams.
It is intended to be a place to store and share code, classes, modules, and documentation. This is **not** an Android FTC app project.

Read the code and any instructions before you cut and paste it into your project. Most of the items included here are meant to help speed up your development by minimizing the "re-invent the wheel" syndrome and at the same time help you to understand various aspects of software development.

> **Note:** The classes under the *TeamCodeSamples* folder are OpModes and supporting classes which may have dependencies on either the FTC software development kit or other external libraries. Be aware that you may need to install some of these if they are not already in your project.

## Instructions

- Read the code and any documentation.
- Decide if it might be useful in your project.
- Copy it to your project. Copy and paste is probably the easiest for most code.
- Make any changes required to incorporate it into your code.
- Create some test code to verify it does what you expect.
