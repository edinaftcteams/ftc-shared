# GitHub and YouTube

If you are using github for documentation here is a way to include youtube videos in you markdown text.

## Step 1: Get the YouTube Video ID

The YouTube video ID is the part of the URL after the v=. For example, in the URL [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ. You'll need that for the next step.

## Step 2: Embed the Video

To embed the video, use the following markdown:
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
YouTube already has a thumbnail image for the video, so you can use that. Just replace YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE with the video ID you got in step 1 in the first URL (for the image). Then again in the second URL (for the link to the video).

Here is a sample video created by Piece of Cake.
