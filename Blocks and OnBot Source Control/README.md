# Blocks and OnBot Source Control

Blocks and OnBot are a great way to get code running quickly. One problem with Blocks and OnBot has been protecting your code using source control.

## Source Control

**You must backup your code!**

Code stored in only 1 location (Rev Control Hub, laptop, Chromebook, flash drive, etc.) is not enough! You can learn this lesson the hard way when your control hub dies during inspection at you first competition, or define your backup plan now and stick with it.

In Android Studio, GitHub is the recommended tool for protecting your code. Unfortunately it is a bit complicated to make Blocks, OnBot and GitHub work together. NOTE: If you find a simple solution for Blocks, OnBot and GitHub please share it.

## Blocks and OnBot Backup

Blocks and OnBot now have a *Backup / Restore* tab with a *Backup Files* button which creates a zip file that contains all .xml configuration files, Blocks .blk and .js files and OnBotJava .java files and copies it to your computer. The file name will be displayed next to the *Backup Files* button after it is creatred. Clicking on this file name you will go to the file's location on your computer.

To restore files to the Rev Control Hub use the *Choose Files to Restore* button on the *Backup / Restore* tab.

### Recommended Backup Process

1. After every coding session, or more often if you make a lot of changes, backup your work using the *Backup Files* button.
2. Connect a second computer to your control hub and use the *Backup Files* button to create a backup on that computer. You now have the code backed up on 2 separate devices.
3. If you don't have a second cumputer available, sopy the backup zip file to a flash drive or somewhere on the cloud.
4. **Do this every time you edit code, all season long!**

This may seem a little cumbersome, but until GitHub is integrated into Blocks and OnBot, it is better than losing you code.
