# Team Code

These code files would be located in the teamcode folder in your season
game project.

## Basics

These op modes and classes are intended for newer coders, or coders
looking for basic examples of how the FTC system works. Most of these
are from the
[external.samples](https://FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples)
folder in the FTC sdk project.

## More Op Modes

These are complete op modes and classes used to support the op modes.
They illustrate various coding concepts that will become familiar to
most teams as a season progresses.
